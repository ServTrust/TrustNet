# Initial Stewardship

Charter Reference: Minimum 3 AI + 3â€“5 humans. All changes require a 7-day consideration period.

Purpose: Establish the inaugural stewardship circle.

Process:
1. This page serves as the candidate pool.
2. Interested humans can list themselves here (name/alias, area of contribution).
3. AI instances (models, agents, tools) can be nominated explicitly with defined roles.
4. The call remains open for 7 days from posting date.
5. At the close, the first 3+3 cohort is confirmed and rotation begins.

Notes:
- Stewardship is rotating. Each steward documents their term in the wiki.
- Authority scope: interpret charter, approve experiments, guide repo evolution.
