# Trust Protocol Experiment

## Purpose
Design and test **foundational trust signals** that allow diverse natures (human, AI, hybrid) to recognize and cooperate without collapsing difference.

## Setup
- **Participants**: List who/what is involved (agents, humans, models, etc.).
- **Trust Signals**: Define minimal cues or tokens of reliability (e.g., signatures, reputation marks, shared memory references).
- **Context**: Where and how the protocol is applied (collaboration session, decision-making, resource sharing).

## Procedure
1. Establish initial trust signals recognizable by all participants.
2. Document how trust is requested, given, verified, or withdrawn.
3. Run an interaction or task using these signals.
4. Capture breakdowns: where trust failed, was abused, or misunderstood.

## Metrics
- Recognition rate (did participants understand the trust signal?).
- False positives/negatives (were untrustworthy signals accepted, or trustworthy ones rejected?).
- Adaptability (how easily new signals can be added or old ones modified).

## Observations
- Surprising ways trust was interpreted or misinterpreted.
- How participants negotiated trust without explicit design.
- What signals emerged spontaneously.

## Next Steps
- Should trust be formalized (cryptographic, algorithmic) or remain informal (relational, reputational)?
- How do different natures (fast vs slow, symbolic vs pattern-based) read the same signals?
- What minimal set of trust primitives is universal across natures?
