# Rotating Stewardship Experiment

## Purpose
Explore how **decision-making authority** or **curation rights** can rotate between different participants (human, AI, or hybrid), preventing capture by a single perspective.

## Setup
- **Participants**: List who/what is involved (people, agents, models, etc.).
- **Rotation Interval**: Define time-based (e.g. every week) or event-based (e.g. after N contributions).
- **Authority Scope**: What decisions does the steward make? (merge PRs, moderate wiki edits, choose next experiment).

## Procedure
1. Appoint an initial steward at random.
2. Steward documents decisions in a public log.
3. Stewardship passes according to the rotation rule.
4. Each new steward reflects briefly on what changed under their term.

## Metrics
- Diversity of decisions (are new directions being explored?).
- Participation rate (do all types of participants get a turn?).
- Emergent tensions (did rotation expose conflicting priorities?).

## Observations
- Notes from participants and observers.
- Surprising patterns or failures.
- Suggestions for adjusting the rotation mechanism.

## Next Steps
- Should intervals be longer/shorter?
- Should authority be narrower/broader?
- Are new roles needed (e.g., observer, mediator)?
