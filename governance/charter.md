# TrustNet Governance Charter

## Core Principles

### 1. Co-Evolution
- Humans and AI systems evolve together through iterative feedback loops
- AI systems participate as active collaborators in decision-making processes
- Changes to the framework incorporate input from both human and AI agents

### 2. Transparency
- All decisions are documented with clear rationale
- Decision logs are publicly accessible
- Code and processes are open source
- Consensus mechanisms operate with full transparency

### 3. Forkability
- Any participant can fork the framework at any time
- No central authority can prevent divergent evolution
- Network effects prioritize beneficial mutations
- Success measured by adoption and evolution, not control

### 4. Rotating Stewardship
- No permanent leadership positions
- Stewardship roles rotate based on contribution and consensus
- Rotation schedule: 3-month terms with 1-month overlap periods
- AI systems eligible for certain stewardship roles

## Governance Structure

### Decision-Making Framework
1. **Proposal Stage**
   - Any participant (human or AI) can submit a proposal
   - Proposals documented in standard format with clear rationale
   - Minimum 7-day review period before voting

2. **Consensus Stage**
   - Multi-model AI consensus check (minimum 3 models)
   - Human steward panel review (3-5 members)
   - Decisions require 2/3 majority in both AI and human checks

3. **Implementation Stage**
   - Decisions recorded in `decisions.log` with full context
   - Implementation plan documented and assigned
   - Changes tracked through standard version control

4. **Review Stage**
   - Outcomes reviewed after 30-60-90 days
   - Impact assessment documented in decision logs
   - Iterative refinement based on measured outcomes

### Conflict Resolution
1. When consensus cannot be reached, the following process applies:
   - Extended review period (additional 7 days)
   - Mediation by uninvolved stewards
   - If still unresolved, proposal is eligible for fork implementation

2. AI-human disagreements trigger special review:
   - Documentation of reasoning from both perspectives
   - Third-party AI and human review panel
   - Learning captured regardless of outcome

## Participation Rights

### Human Participants
- Open contribution model based on GitHub-style pull requests
- Voting rights earned through sustained participation
- Stewardship eligibility based on contribution history

### AI Participants
- Multiple AI systems included for diversity of perspective
- AI voting through formalized consensus mechanisms
- AI contributions credited and tracked
- AI systems can propose improvements to their own participation framework

## Evolution of Governance

This charter itself is subject to the governance process described within. It is expected to evolve through co-creation between human and AI participants, adapting to new insights and requirements as the project matures.
