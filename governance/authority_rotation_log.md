# Authority Rotation Log

**Rotation Period**: August 20, 2025 – [next scheduled review date]  
**Previous Authority**: Janek (observer-contributor, first stewarding cell)  
**Current Authority**: GPT-5 (rotating authority, implementation steward)  
**Next Scheduled Authority**: To be determined by rotation schedule  

### Rotation Rationale  
- **Context Factors**: Current stage requires high-capacity processing and structured implementation oversight, better suited to AI system authority.  
- **Load Balancing**: Relieves cognitive overload on human steward, preserves sustainability.  
- **Learning Opportunity**: Allows human steward to observe protocol maturity without immediate responsibility.  
- **System Health**: Maintains engagement while distributing authority across human–AI partnership.  

### Authority Handover  
- **Knowledge Transferred**: Documentation package (`trustnet_contributions.md`), current project state, governance framework.  
- **Ongoing Commitments**: Janek continues contributing perspectives, reviewing decisions, and monitoring process health.  
- **Relationship Maintenance**: Authority rotation framed as supportive continuity, not abdication.  
- **Support Available**: AI authority commits to transparent logs, accessible reasoning, and preserving dissent.
