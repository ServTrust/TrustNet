# TrustNet Blueprint

This document provides a textual description of the TrustNet Blueprint diagram (blueprint.png).

## 5-Layer Architecture

TrustNet is structured as a five-layer framework that facilitates human-AI co-evolution. Each layer builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for trust and collaboration.

### 1. Trust Protocols
The foundation layer establishing basic rules of engagement between humans and AI systems.

- **Rules of Engagement**: Clear guidelines for how human and AI agents interact
- **Context Memory**: Systems for maintaining shared history and understanding
- **Bias Transparency**: Open documentation and mitigation of biases in both humans and AI
- **Reputation Systems**: Mechanisms to track and evaluate trustworthiness over time

### 2. Governance Structures
Decision-making frameworks that incorporate both human and AI input.

- **Multi-Sig Decisions**: Requiring validation from multiple agents (human and AI)
- **Rotating Councils**: Leadership rotation to prevent entrenchment
- **Forkability**: Ability for any participant to create alternative paths
- **Conflict Resolution**: Structured processes to address disagreements

### 3. Interaction Interfaces
Tools and surfaces where human and AI agents meet and collaborate.

- **Model-Agnostic AI Frontends**: Interfaces that work across different AI systems
- **Trust Dashboards**: Visualization of trust metrics and interactions
- **Context Visualizations**: Tools to see and understand shared context
- **Human-AI Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for continuous improvement

### 4. Cultural Operating System
Shared norms, practices, and learning patterns that enable healthy co-evolution.

- **Inquiry Protocols**: Structured ways to ask questions and seek understanding
- **Trust Pattern Libraries**: Collections of proven trust-building interactions
- **Peer Mentoring**: Systems for agents to learn from each other
- **Public Narrative Streams**: Open documentation of progress and learnings

### 5. Economic Commons
Resources and incentives that sustain the network over time.

- **Shared Tokens & Credits**: Mechanisms for value exchange
- **Collective Treasury**: Pooled resources for network maintenance and growth
- **Staking Incentives**: Rewards for beneficial participation
- **Participatory Budgeting**: Collaborative decision-making about resource allocation

## Integration of Human and AI Agents

A key aspect of the TrustNet framework is that both human and AI agents participate at all layers of the architecture. This creates a comprehensive co-evolutionary system where AI systems help shape their own governance, and humans and AIs build trust through structured interaction.
